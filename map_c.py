			Calculating signal received by sensor 1 :=
				(1) The signal is simply the density of sand covered in the area of sensor 
				(i.e. sensor 1 here).
				(2) We have value '1' if there is sand & value '0' otherwise, in 
				each respective cell of 'sand' array.
				(3) We calculate sum of total '1' values present in sand matrix using 
				values of 'sensor1_x' & 'sensor1_y'.
				(4) Consider all sensors can sense upto 20 by 20 cells (i.e. 20x20 = pixels) around.
				(5) So, we used 'int(self.sensor1_x) - 10' from PREVIOUS 10 pixels & 
				'int(self.sensor1_x) + 10' upto NEXT 10 pixels resulting 20 pixels of X-axis.
				Similarly, 'int(self.sensor1_y) - 10' from PREVIOUS 10 pixels & 
				'int(self.sensor1_x) + 10' upto NEXT 10 pixels resulting 20 pixels of Y-axis.
				(6) Finally, to get density of total '1' values, we divide that sum by 400 
				(since sensor can sense 400 pixels i.e. 20x20)
